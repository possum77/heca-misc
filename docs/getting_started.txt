                ===========================================
                GETTING STARTED WITH linux-heca AND libheca
                ===========================================

The following guide will show you how to build and install the heca kernel and
userspace library for working with it. Since typically, you will want to build
the kernel on a separate machine from the installation machine, this guide has
been split into a build section and a installation section. The sequences
documented here have been tested on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, using root permissions.

On the build host
=================

Setup environment for build machine
-----------------------------------

First setup GIT:

    apt-get install git-core

Setup kernel build environment:

    apt-get install build-essential
    apt-get install libncurses5 libncurses5-dev

Setup initrd.img related tools:

    apt-get install multipath-tools kpartx arping dracut

We export Build hosts' root directory via NFS, to be later used by Target hosts

First install NFS server package:

    apt-get install nfs-kernel-server
    chkconfig nfsserver on

Export / directory by adding the below to /etc/exports:

/ *(rw)

Refresh the NFS server

    service nfs-kernel-server restart

Build the kernel
----------------
First download the linux-heca repository from github, using:

    git clone http://github.com/hecatonchire/linux-heca.git

An optional (but recommended) step is to download the .config file from the
following URL into the linux-heca folder to make the kernel installation
procedure a bit easier.

    wget --no-check-certificate https://raw.github.com/hecatonchire/heca-misc/master/kernel/.config

Inside the linux-heca directory, to build the kernel, first run make
menuconfig. Select any additional kernel modules to install as required.

    make menuconfig

Make sure you have enough free space on the disk (minimum of 20 GBs)

    df -h .

Invoke a parallel kernel build using all cores

    make -j`nproc` all
    make -j`nproc` headers_check

Building libheca
----------------

While it is possible to interact with Hecatonchire Kernel directly via the
exposed ioctl interface, we also provide a wrapper named libheca, exposing an
simpler user-mode API.

The libheca is available from the libheca repository from github. This can be
done by cloning the source with git using this command:

    git clone http://github.com/hecatonchire/libheca.git

Setup environment so that it points to location of linux-heca

    export LINUX_INCLUDE_PATH=$PWD/linux-heca/include

Navigate to the libheca folder and build and install by running:

    make

Execution on the Target Host
============================

Setup environment on target host machine
----------------------------------------

First setup GIT:

    apt-get install git-core

Setup kernel debug environment:

    apt-get install fakeroot build-essential crash kexec-tools
    apt-get install makedumpfile kernel-wedge
    apt-get install libncurses5 libncurses5-dev libelf-dev binutils-dev

Add RDMA packages:

    apt-get install libibverbs1 libibcm1 libibcm-dev
    apt-get install libibverbs-dev libibcommon1 ibverbs-utils

Setup permissions to access RDMA/IB devices by ensuring that file
/etc/udev/rules.d/40-ib.rules has at-least the following lines:

    KERNEL=="umad*", NAME="infiniband/%k"
    KERNEL=="issm*", NAME="infiniband/%k"
    KERNEL=="ucm*", NAME="infiniband/%k", MODE="0666"
    KERNEL=="uverbs*", NAME="infiniband/%k", MODE="0666"
    KERNEL=="uat", NAME="infiniband/%k", MODE="0666"
    KERNEL=="ucma", NAME="infiniband/%k", MODE="0666"
    KERNEL=="rdma_cm", NAME="infiniband/%k", MODE="0666"

Setup NFS access to the Build hosts' root directory

    mkdir -p /mount/builder
    mount -t nfs builder:/ /mount/builder
    cd /mount/builder

Installing the kernel
---------------------

To install the kernel, execute the following commands (in the kernel build
directory):

    make modules_install
    make headers_install
    make install

Create new init-RAM-disk:

    make kernelrelease
    rm -f /boot/initrd.img-`make kernelrelease`
    dracut -l -f /boot/initrd.img-`make kernelrelease` `make kernelrelease`
    lsinitramfs /boot/initrd.img-`make kernelrelease` | grep modules.dep

Refresh GRUB bootloader entries:

    update-grub2

Next, reboot the machine and boot into the new kernel:

    reboot

And verify the new kernel has loaded

    uname -r

You will now need to setup the rdma modules. Run the following commands (or add
them to /etc/rc.local):

    modprobe rdma_cm
    modprobe ib_uverbs
    modprobe rdma_ucm

To use with soft iWARP (requires no special RDMA configuration), load the siw
module

    modprobe siw

NOTE: if you have NICs/HBAs that support RDMA (Infiniband, Iwarp, RoCE, etc..)
you will need to configure them so they can be used with rdmacm and libibverbs

Lastly, setup the new heca.ko LKM (Linux Kernel Module)

    modprobe heca

You can check that everything has been loaded correctly by running dmesg and
checking for any errors.

Installing libheca
------------------

Navigate to the libheca folder and build and install by running:

    make install

Running a libheca sanity test
-----------------------------

To run a simple sanity test, navigate to the tests directory under libheca.

Create a <conf_file> using the following example:

    size=512
    1=<Server Node IP Address>:4444
    2=<Client Node IP Address>:4444

For a SoftIWARP device you could use the IP associated with the 'eth0' device:

    /sbin/ifconfig eth0 | grep 'inet addr:' | cut -d: -f2 | awk '{print $1}'

For InfiniBand you could use the IP associated with the 'ib0' device:

    /sbin/ifconfig ib0 | grep 'inet addr:' | cut -d: -f2 | awk '{print $1}'

To run the test, on the server node, run:

    ./tst <conf_file>

On the client node, run:

    ./tst <conf_file> <node_id>

Where with just a single client node, the <node_id> will be 2.

The server node needs to be initialized first, then the client. After that, the
onscreen numbering should be followed to demonstrate the heca system in action.
